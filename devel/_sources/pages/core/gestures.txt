Gesture Events
##############

Based on the :ref:`low-level pointer events <pages/pointer#pointer_events>`, the following gesture events are available in all three of qooxdoo's GUI toolkits (qx.Desktop, qx.Mobile and qx.Website):

* `tap <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/index.html#qx.event.type.Tap>`__: A brief finger/stylus tap or mouse click
* `longtap <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/index.html#qx.event.type.Tap>`__: A tap that is held down for 500 milliseconds
* `dbltap <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/index.html#qx.event.type.Tap>`__: Two taps in quick succession
* `swipe <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/index.html#qx.event.type.Swipe>`__: Horizontal or vertical swipe motion
* `rotate <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/index.html#qx.event.type.Rotate>`__: Two contact points (e.g. fingers) rotating around a central point
* `pinch <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/index.html#qx.event.type.Pinch>`__: Two contact points moving towards or away from each other
* `track <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/index.html#qx.event.type.Track>`__: Cross-device equivalent to mouse drag (fired only between pointerdown and pointerup)
